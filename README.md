### Hello viewer! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub.

***If you're wondering why there are gaps in my GitHub activity:***    
**April - July** - throughout the Enspiral Dev Academy Web Development bootcampwe often worked on paired programming 
and the commits are through another student's GitHub account.    
**August - current** - I am in the process of solidifying my JavaScript techniques on Codewars and HackerRank!

***Things I'm also currently learning outside of GitHub:***
- C# - using CodeAcademy and Udacity
- Vue.js     

***Things I'm actively working on:***
- Kudosu - sudoku game using external API
- Portfolio - https://fai-songprasit.herokuapp.com/
