### Hello viewer! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub.

If you're wondering why there are gaps in my GitHub activity it's probably because I am currently solidifying my JavaScript    
techniques on Codewars and HackerRank!

Things I'm also currently learning outside of GitHub:
- C# - using CodeAcademy and Udacity
- Vue.js     

Things I'm actively working on:
- Kudosu - sudoku game using external API
- Portfolio - https://fai-songprasit.herokuapp.com/
